# Backend Dependencies Fix

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: `express-mongo-sanitize` incompatibility with Express.js 5.x
- **Error**: "Cannot set property query of #<IncomingMessage> which has only a getter"
- **Solution**: Implemented custom MongoDB sanitization middleware

## Changes Made

1. **Custom MongoDB Sanitization**: Replaced `express-mongo-sanitize` with custom middleware in `middleware/security.js`
2. **MongoDB Connection**: Removed deprecated options (`useNewUrlParser`, `useUnifiedTopology`)

## Alternative Solution (if needed)

If you prefer to use the original `express-mongo-sanitize` package, you can downgrade Express:

```bash
cd backend
npm install express@^4.18.2
npm restart
```

Then revert the changes in `middleware/security.js` to use the original:

```javascript
app.use(mongoSanitize({
  replaceWith: '_',
  onSanitize: ({ req, key }) => {
    console.log(`Sanitized key: ${key} in request to ${req.path}`);
  }
}));
```

## Current Status
✅ Server running without errors
✅ MongoDB connected successfully  
✅ Security middleware working properly
✅ Socket.IO connections working
